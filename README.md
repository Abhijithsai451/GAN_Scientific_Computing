# Conditional GAN (cGAN) - Scientific Computing Project

## Overview
This project implements a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The model generates realistic images conditioned on class labels. The project includes:
- Baseline DCGAN implementation
- Improved architecture
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Evaluation and visualization

## Dataset

This project uses the **CIFAR-10 dataset**:
- 60,000 images (50,000 training, 10,000 test)
- Image size: 32 × 32 (RGB)
- 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

All images are normalized to the range **[-1, 1]** to match the generator output (Tanh activation).

## Installation

Install all required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


 How to Run

Train Baseline Model
bash train_baseline_model.sh

Train Improved Model
bash train_improved_model.sh

Run Hyperparameter Tuning
bash run_tuner.sh

The scripts internally call main.py with the appropriate configuration files.




## Model Architecture


Generator (G)

The Generator is a conditional deep convolutional network.

Input:
Random noise vector (z)
Class label embedding

Architecture:
Uses nn.Embedding for label conditioning
Concatenates noise and label embedding
Uses ConvTranspose2d layers for upsampling
Feature map progression:
1×1 → 4×4 → 8×8 → 16×16 → 32×32

Activation:
ReLU (hidden layers)
Tanh (output layer)

Output:
32×32 RGB image in range [-1, 1]


Discriminator (D)

The Discriminator is a conditional convolutional network.

Input:
Image (real or generated)
Class label embedding
Architecture:
Uses Conv2d with stride=2 for downsampling
Feature map progression:
32×32 → 16×16 → 8×8 → 4×4
Batch Normalization (except first layer)
LeakyReLU activation
Special Feature:
Uses Global Average Pooling (GAP) instead of flattening
Reduces parameters and improves generalization
Output:
Single scalar representing real/fake score




## Training Strategy

The model follows a Conditional GAN training process:

Loss Function
Binary Cross Entropy with Logits (BCEWithLogitsLoss)

Optimizer
Adam optimizer for both Generator and Discriminator
β1 = 0.5, β2 = 0.999

Training Steps
Train Discriminator:
Real images → label = 1
Fake images → label = 0
Train Generator:
Fake images → label = 1 (to fool discriminator)

Metrics Tracked
Generator Loss
Discriminator Loss
D(x): output for real images
D(G(z)): output for generated images
